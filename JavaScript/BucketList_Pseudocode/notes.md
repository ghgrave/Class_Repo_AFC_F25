BucketList App

HTML = form
After browser loads:
     be able to see all items on load = cRud = read
1 input = description of bucketlist item
button = submit
click submit 

create a new task = Crud = create
how do we get data from form to JavaScript?
Validation issues?
ok?
     "display" it at the END of current list
not ok?
     handle errors/issues

Any time:
     toggle complete tasks = crUd = update
     be able to remove bucketlist item from "database" = cruD = delete


Code : what do we need?
need a fake database  = array of objects
object = represent our bucketlist item (task) = Item
array of bucketlist items = bucketItemList

functions =
DeleteItem()
UpdateItem()
ReadItems()
CreateItem()

Research = array methods
does something exist?
what if I need to filter?
how do we delete an object from array?

how to toggle data in JavaScript?
