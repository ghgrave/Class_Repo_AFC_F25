// DECOMPOSITION

// We need to find the area of a geometric shape

//What do we need to think about?

//do functions exist?
//wow - what shape cuz they have different strategies for area?
//how many valuers do we need to pass in? Circle = 1, triangle = 2, rectangle = 2, square = 1

//function that takes two arguments, first arg is string with name of shape, 2nd arg is an ARRAY of values
// Are we going to build ALL test now, or one by one????
// test to see if first arg is string
//     probably need to check against a list
//second argument must be an array.
//  is an empty array same as no array?

//array exist and has values?
