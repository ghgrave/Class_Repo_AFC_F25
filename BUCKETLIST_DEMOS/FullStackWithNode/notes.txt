Can only use these two routes!!!
/api/bucket
/api/bucket/:id

Must return everything as JSON.

VERBS
CRUD functional API
Create data - POST verb
Read data - GET verb
Update data - PUT verb
Delete data - DELETE verb

RULES:
1) WE determine endpoints
2) WE determine HOW data will be sent back
3) WE determine how MUCH data to send back
4) WE determine the structure data

READ
1) endpoint - GET verb and /api/bucket
2) send back data -> JSON
3) send back everything -> array of objects
4) object structure:
    {
        id: 1,
        description: "Call mom!!!",
        isComplete: false,
    }

CREATE
1) endpoint - POST and /api/bucket
2) send back data -> JSON

4) send back ONE object - SAVED form the database
